# useGoogleMap

The `<GoogleMap />` component does not include functionality to load the Google Maps API. This means you need to handle the API loading yourself.

To achieve this, you can use the exported `useGoogleMap` hook, which is built on top of [`@googlemaps/js-api-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@googlemaps/js-api-loader).

Please ensure that the configuration object you pass has a stable reference. Otherwise, unnecessary API loads and re-renders may occur. To avoid this, you can:

- Promote the configuration to a global variable.
- Wrap the configuration using caching methods like `useMemo`.

Alternatively, you can load the Google Maps API using your own script. Once the API is loaded, simply pass the required `map` instance and the `google.maps` object to the `<GoogleMap />` component.
